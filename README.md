## :dart: About ##

That Wallpaper App is just another wallpaper app which no one really wants. Just like any other wallpaper app, this one also does not have anything special or unique (apart for the fact that I am developing it). Since creating a wallpaper app has become a trend in begineers flutter community, I thought why not give it a shot and see where I end up.

This project is created just out of curiosity and it will probably never get officially released on any of the app stores. However, I'll probably keep on releasing apks on github releases as and when I see fit.

The main aim of this repo is to showcase an ideal architecture for a wallpaper app (in my opinion of course ðŸ˜…). I am bad at UI stuff, so probably user experience of this app might not be up to the mark. But still, if you want to use this source, feel free to do so after going through the added license.
